# Nigerian-Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition
Nigerian-Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition (NANPR) is an advanced project designed to automatically detect and recognize vehicle number plates in Nigeria. Leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning techniques, NANPR aims to streamline and enhance the efficiency of traffic management, law enforcement, and vehicle-related data collection in Nigeria.
## Project Overview
The NANPR system is built to accurately identify and read number plates from images and video streams in real-time. This system is tailored specifically for Nigerian number plates, taking into account their unique design and alphanumeric structure. The main features of the NANPR project include:
1. **Real-time number plate detection:** Quickly identifies number plates from live video feeds or pre-recorded footage.
2. **High accuracy recognition:** Utilizes advanced machine learning models to accurately recognize alphanumeric characters on the plates.
3. **Localization and extraction:** Precisely locates the number plate within an image and extracts the relevant region for recognition.
4. **Scalability:** Designed to handle large volumes of data, making it suitable for deployment in urban and rural areas alike.
## Tech Stack
The NANPR project employs a cutting-edge tech stack to ensure high performance and accuracy:
1. **YOLOvX (You Only Look Once - Version X)**: YOLOvX is the core component of the number plate detection system. It is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. YOLOvX processes images and video frames in real-time, making it ideal for dynamic environments like roadways and checkpoints.
2. **Python:** Python is used as the primary programming language for developing the NANPR system. Its extensive libraries and frameworks for computer vision and deep learning, such as OpenCV and TensorFlow, make it an excellent choice for this project.
3. **OpenCV:** OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is utilized for image processing tasks, including pre-processing of input images, contour detection, and plate localization. OpenCV provides efficient tools to handle real-time image and video processing.
4. **PyTorch:** PyTorch serves as the backbone for training and deploying the neural networks used in the NANPR system. Its flexibility and scalability make it suitable for both the initial model development phase and large-scale deployment.
5. **Flask**: Flask is used to create a lightweight web server for the NANPR system. It handles HTTP requests, allowing users to upload images or video streams for processing and receive the recognition results.
6. **Docker:** Docker is employed to containerize the NANPR application, ensuring a consistent and reproducible environment across different deployment platforms. Docker facilitates easy scaling and management of the application in production.
7. **SQL/NoSQL Databases:** SQL/NoSQL Databases are used to store and manage the recognized number plate data, along with metadata such as timestamps and geographical locations. This facilitates efficient data retrieval and analysis for reporting and monitoring purposes.
## How It Works
1. **Image/Video Input**: The system takes input from cameras or uploaded files.
2. **Pre-Processing:** Images are pre-processed to enhance quality and isolate regions of interest.
3. **Detection:** YOLOvX detects the number plate within the image.
4. **Recognition:** The detected plate is cropped and passed to a recognition model to identify the alphanumeric characters.
5. **Output:** The recognized number plate data is displayed to the user or stored in the database for further use.
# Advantages of NANPR
The NANPR system offers several significant advantages that extend beyond simple number plate recognition:
1. **Study of Traffic Patterns**
  - ***Traffic Analysis:*** By collecting and analyzing data on vehicle movements, NANPR enables the study of traffic patterns, helping authorities understand peak travel times, congestion points, and overall traffic flow.
2. **Better Road Traffic Planning**
  - ***Infrastructure Development:*** Insights from NANPR data can inform the planning and development of road infrastructure, leading to more efficient traffic management and reduced congestion.
  - ***Optimization:*** Traffic lights, road signs, and other infrastructure can be optimized based on real-time traffic data.
3. **Prediction of Traffic**
  - ***Traffic Forecasting:*** By studying the travel frequency of certain vehicles, NANPR can help predict traffic volumes in specific regions at different times, aiding in proactive traffic management and resource allocation.
4. **Classification of Vehicles**
  - ***Route-Based Classification***: Vehicles can be classified based on their travel routes, helping in the identification of common travel patterns and potentially distinguishing between different types of road users, such as commercial vs. private vehicles.
5. **Enhanced Security**
  - ***Law Enforcement:*** NANPR can assist in tracking stolen vehicles, identifying unregistered vehicles, and enforcing traffic laws more effectively.
  - ***Surveillance:*** Integration with security systems to monitor and manage high-risk areas or events.

NANPR is poised to revolutionize the way vehicle number plates are detected and recognized in Nigeria, providing a robust solution for various applications in traffic management, security, and beyond. Beginning at Federal agencies and institutions such as; Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Airports, and much more.
